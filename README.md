# Project-Feature-Analysis-with-Yellowbrick
### Feature Analysis
Feature analysis argues that we observe individual characteristics, or features, of every object and pattern we encounter. Recognition-by-components theory maintains that we sort objects into their component parts (3D shapes called geons) as a way of recognizing them.

### Yellowbrick
Yellowbrick is a suite of visual analysis and diagnostic tools designed to facilitate machine learning with scikit-learn. The library implements a new core API object, the Visualizer that is an scikit-learn estimator â€” an object that learns from data. Similar to transformers or models, visualizers learn from data by creating a visual representation of the model selection workflow.

Visualizer allow users to steer the model selection process, building intuition around feature engineering, algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. For instance, they can help diagnose common problems surrounding model complexity and bias, heteroscedasticity, underfit and overtraining, or class balance issues. By applying visualizers to the model selection workflow, Yellowbrick allows you to steer predictive models toward more successful results, faster.
